        Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955,
        London, England), British computer scientist, generally credited as the
        inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by
        Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium
        Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award
        Foundation. Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his
        parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer.
        (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in
        1976 from the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer
        software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in
        Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the
        computer industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a
        software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics
        laboratory in Geneva.
